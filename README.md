## 📝 Project Description
ShopNow is a clean, fast, single‑page shopping experience built with modern, framework‑free JavaScript, modular CSS, and accessible HTML. It simulates a real e‑commerce flow end‑to‑end while keeping everything client‑side for easy demo and grading.

Highlights:
- Dynamic home with hero, “Shop by Category,” top deals, trending, best sellers, and brand strip. Category and brand tiles auto‑pull real product images from the catalog for authenticity.
- Products Listing (PLP) with contextual filters: brands list adapts to the current category/subcategory/search/discount; pagination, sorting, and deep‑linkable URLs are supported.
- Product Details (PDP) with image gallery, price/offer breakdown, sizes, add‑to‑bag, and wishlist actions.
- Cart and Wishlist powered by localStorage; quantities, remove, and totals are persisted across reloads.
- Lightweight data layer that generates a curated catalog and supports brand/sub‑category image overrides (custom links provided).
- Mock authentication with a demo account; header greets the signed‑in user and updates counts globally.

Tech approach:
- ES Modules, semantic HTML, CSS variables, responsive layout, and minimal dependencies for fast loads.
- Simple utilities (debounce, DOM helpers), componentized header/footer/product card, and clear file structure for maintainability.
